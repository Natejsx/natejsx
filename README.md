## Good Morning!👋 

# About Me:
**`Full-stack Web Developer & Computer Science Student`**<br/>
I’m a web developer focused on building intuitive user experiences, scalable systems, and tools that help developers work faster and more effectively. I specialize in React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern frontend engineering, and I’ve built everything from full-stack web applications and custom CSS frameworks to a fully transpiled programming language.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, after earning my Associate of Science in Computer Science. During my time at San Jacinto College, I served as President of the Computer Science Organization, where I led workshops, collaborative projects, and community events designed to help students grow as software engineers.

I also worked as a Student Instructor for Programming I & II, providing one-on-one support, debugging assistance, and clear explanations of core programming concepts. In this role, I developed hands-on exercises and mini-projects, delivered select lectures, and led lab sessions with live coding to help students bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
