## Good Morning!👋 

# About Me:
**`Web Developer & Computer Scientist`**<br/>
I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer and computer scientist, dedicated to contributing to the digital world one line of code at a time. My journey began in my sophomore year of high school when I took AP Computer Science, and from there, I developed a deep love for programming. Since then, I've continued to grow, learning and building as I go. Currently, I am a sophomore in College, majoring in Computer Science. I'm actively involved in my field, serving as the President of the Computer Science Club on my South Campus, and I'm also a co-owner of the SJC Computer Science Organization.
